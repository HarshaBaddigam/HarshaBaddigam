As someone who strongly believes that "Knowledge is the Future Currency," I have dedicated my educational journey and career path to continuously acquiring new skills and pushing the boundaries of my capabilities. From a young age, my innate curiosity led me to disassemble and examine the inner workings of technology, sparking my fascination with the digital realm. This passion eventually led me to specialize in cybersecurity during my undergraduate studies, setting the stage for my journey into the realm of digital defense.   

## Objective

I am dedicated to ensuring the security and integrity of digital assets and data. Seeking a challenging role in cybersecurity to apply my knowledge and skills, proactively defend against emerging threats, and contribute to strengthening an organization's security posture.
